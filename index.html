    NewEye on Tech Business like Milk packets supply to customer houses by day before started that means when the guy starts with the Coffee so early morning 5:00 if we serve Haritaged milk to customers then the people start their day activity. And the Andhra Government started encouraging the Drone industry in Amaravathi so if the government supports will start a new startup company with young entrepreneurs by supplying Andhara Favorite Milk that is Haritage Milk which  is Chief Minister Nara Chandra babu Naidu's Firm Milk will reach all over Andhra by before sun light and Andhra people will make thier bad Coffee.
My request to give the opportunity to us for this StartUp Company to improve Haritage Milk income and improve State GDP by profitable StartUps

<h3> To address these issues, AP needs systemic reforms, including:</h3><H4>  ----------------   ''<h3>

- If nessery Dumping duty could be do every 20 Days but
<br> - Dump should went to Dumping Yard not into Drainage
<br> - & Process should be done in Hours not in couple of Weeks
<br> - Because trush have bad smell like political leadrs or stars
